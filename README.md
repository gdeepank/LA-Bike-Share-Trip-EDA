LA Metro Bike Share Trip Data
The objective of the project was to understand the given dataset completely, and perform exploratory data analysis on it. This entailed in using knowledge acquired from the class sessions to plot visualizations which would help understand the dataset better, and derive insights
from it. However, the main focus of this project was to augment theoretical learning of the class with invaluable hands-on knowledge. This project was also meant to increase awareness and encourage exploration of fields and topics which are overlapping with the field of Data Science.
